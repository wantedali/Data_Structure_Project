# Online Shopping

## Overview
**Online_Shopping** is a **C++**-based application that implements an **online shopping system** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. The project focuses on providing an efficient and seamless shopping experience by utilizing well-designed **data structures** and optimized **algorithms** to handle various operations such as product management, cart functionality, and order processing.

## Features
- **User Authentication:** Allows customers to register, log in, and manage their accounts securely.
- **Product Catalog:** Users can browse products, search, and apply filters.
- **Shopping Cart:** Users can manage their shopping cart, adding or removing items efficiently.
- **Order Management:** Customers can view order history, while admins can track orders and manage inventory.
- **Secure Checkout:** Completes purchases using an optimized and secure payment mechanism.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures, Algorithms


## Design and Architecture
The project is designed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to maintain a clean and maintainable codebase:
- **Encapsulation:** Classes such as `User`, `Product`, `Cart`, and `Order` encapsulate all the relevant attributes and behaviors.
- **Inheritance:** Extend base classes for common functionality and reduce code duplication.
- **Polymorphism:** Provides flexibility through dynamic method calls and overrides, especially for different types of users (admin vs. customer).
- **Data Structures:** Utilizes efficient data structures such as arrays, linked lists, hash tables, or trees to manage data efficiently.
- **Algorithms:** Implements optimized algorithms for searching, sorting, and managing product catalogs, shopping cart, and order processing.
